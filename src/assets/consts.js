    "Living in times of uncertainty and stressed environment is not easy. Especially when the media is flooded with fear and red screens with apocalyptic fake-news scenarios broadcasted and presented as pure truth. This initiative is the product of my belief that the other side should be seen and heard. The good news was always here around the corner, we just normally tend to ignore them. Whether you're in quarantine or not, this tough period bears along itâ€™s down sides also hopeful aspects, with hope for a brighter future. Being positive is the reasonable and most beneficial thing to do.",

    "This project is an open source code that I've created to reduce the level of stress worldwide. I'm Oren, just another human being on this earth. I'm trying to live life to the fullest, be aware yet calm and minded. I feel that this is the situation is a wake call for us to shed off our old patterns, pay attention to what is worth at really matters. Time to cut the expenses of unnecessary consuming habit, burning time instead of being with our beloved ones. Time to wake up as humanity, in sake of our green planet health. Time to reconnect."
